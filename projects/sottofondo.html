                            Sottofondo is a magazine that approaches environmentalism in a broad and unconventional way. 
                            Moving beyond the typical association with ecology, it delves into the concept of environmentalism as the influence of environmental factors on human personality and behavior. 
                            The project examines the environment not just as nature, but as the space and context in which humans live, move, and interact.

                            The zero issue of Sottofondo focuses on acoustic pollution, using it as an exemplary case to explore how everyday sounds and noises are undervalued in our overstimulated world. The issue challenges the perception of sound as a neutral background and proposes that we re-educate ourselves to engage with this overlooked element of our environment. The aim is to foster critical awareness of the ways in which sound—or its neglect—shapes human behavior and societal norms.                            <br>

                            For this project, I was involved in all phases, with a primary focus on concept development. I curated the selection of articles and artists, ensuring diverse perspectives and authoritative voices shaped the content. 
                            The editorial team emphasized a constructive critique, encouraging readers to question and explore rather than simply consume predefined answers.
